"""Arithmetic helper functions for the sample application.

This module defines two dependency-free, standard-library-only helpers:
``calculate_total`` (summation) and ``calculate_average`` (averaging) of a list
of numbers. The companion ``app.py`` imports and calls only ``calculate_total``;
``calculate_average`` is a provided-but-currently-unused part of the public API.
`Source: app.py:L1-L16`.
The module performs no I/O, defines no classes or module-level state, and
imports nothing.

Public API:
    * ``calculate_total(numbers)`` — return the arithmetic sum of a list.
    * ``calculate_average(numbers)`` — return the arithmetic mean of a list.

def calculate_total(numbers):
    """Return the arithmetic sum of a list of numbers.

    Iterates over the input, accumulating each element into a running total
    that starts at ``0``. Because the accumulator starts at zero, an empty
    list yields ``0``.

    Args:
        numbers: A list (or other iterable) of ``int``/``float`` values to sum.

    Returns:
        The sum of all elements; ``0`` for an empty list.

def calculate_average(numbers):

    Returns ``0`` when ``numbers`` is empty or otherwise falsey; this guard
    prevents a division-by-zero. For a non-empty input it delegates to
    :func:`calculate_total` and divides the sum by the element count.

    Args:
        numbers: A list (or other sized iterable) of ``int``/``float`` values.

    Returns:
        ``0`` for a falsey/empty input; otherwise the sum divided by the
