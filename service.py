"""Numeric calculation utilities for the parent repository.

This module provides pure, standard-library-only helper functions for simple
numeric aggregation. It exposes two functions:

* ``calculate_total`` -- iteratively sum a numeric iterable.
* ``calculate_average`` -- compute the arithmetic mean of a numeric iterable.

The module has no imports, no classes, and no module-level state. Every
function is side-effect free: none performs I/O and none mutates its input,
which makes the utilities safe to reuse and trivial to test. The code targets
Python 3.6+.

def calculate_total(numbers):
    """Iteratively sum the elements of a numeric iterable.

    Walks the input a single time, accumulating each element into a running
    ``total``. This is a pure function with no side effects; it neither
    performs I/O nor mutates the supplied iterable.

    Args:
        numbers (list[int | float] | iterable of numbers): The numeric values
            to sum. Elements are assumed to be numeric (AAP §3.1).

    Returns:
        int | float: The accumulated total of all elements. Returns ``0`` for
        an empty iterable (the natural result of summing zero elements).

    total = 0

    # Iterate over each element and accumulate it into the running ``total``.
    for number in numbers:
        total += number

def calculate_average(numbers):
    """Compute the arithmetic mean of a numeric iterable.

    Delegates summation to :func:`calculate_total` and divides the total by
    the number of elements. Division by zero is guarded by returning ``0``
    when the input is empty or otherwise falsey.

    Note:
        This function is defined but never invoked anywhere in the project
        (AAP §1.2.2); it is documented here for completeness and API coverage.

    Args:
        numbers (list[int | float]): The numeric values to average.

    Returns:
        int | float: The average (total divided by count). Returns ``0`` for
        empty/falsey input to avoid division by zero.
